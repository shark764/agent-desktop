# CSS

This app uses [`Radium`](http://formidable.com/open-source/radium/)
allowing you to write your CSS in your JavaScript

`Radium` unlocks the power of React & inline styling by enabling support for CSS pseudo selectors, media queries, vendor-prefixing, and much more through a simple interface..

For responsive layout we are using vanilla [`flex-box`](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
A handy generator can be found at [`flexy-boxes`](http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/)
